# Simple Servlet Example

Welcome to the Simple Servlet example! This example demonstrates how to deploy a simple servlet application to WebLogic.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell
mvn package
```

> Note: If build correctly, you will see a `target` directory with the `simpleservlet-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war` file.

To deploy the application, you can use the WebLogic Server Remote Console or the WebLogic Scripting Tool (WLST).
